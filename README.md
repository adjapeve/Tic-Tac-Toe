# Tic-Tac-Toe

This program was made as part of The Odin Project assignments, it uses factories and modules to keep the code organized and add closure, it also implements a pub-sub
pattern to link modules and factories as needed withouth exposing methods in global scope.
It also implements web responsiveness for mobile devices through CSS media queries.
